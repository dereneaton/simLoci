`simLoci` is a simple Python program to simulate sequence data on an input topology with gene flow. It uses the coalescent simulator in the Python package `Egglib` and also requires `Numpy`. 

Data can be output in a number of formats: 
+ LOCI format (used by _pyRAD_)  
+ PHY format (used by _raxml_)  
+ NEX format (used by _BEAST_)  
+ STR format (used by _STRUCTURE_)  
+ MIG format (used by _migrate-N_)
