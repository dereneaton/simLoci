## simLoci
The program `simLoci` can be used to simulate sequence data on an input topology with gene flow. It uses a coalescent simulator from the Python package `Egglib` and also requires `Numpy`. It allows fast simulation of data under a range of parameter values and with data output in a variety of formats:  

     .LOCI (used by pyRAD)  
     .PHY  (used by raxml)  
     .NEX  (used by BEAST)  
     .STR  (used by STRUCTURE)  
     .MIG  (used by migrate-N)
